A node project must have a package.json...
You can create one manually, but the easiest way to
add one to your project is to run the command 'npm init'


- The app.get is getting my files in my directory in my server.js
 - GET our HTTP method
- '/greeting' the location we need to go to make a request
- req, res client makes request, server sends response
